MERN stack

UI:
- Scrollable list of current users signed up and who is up next highlighted at the top
    - Show up to 10 people signed up
- Button to sign up to sing
    - Prompts user for name, song title, and artist
    - Checks to make sure the song requested is in the MongoDB catalog (this is a nice to have I think)
- Button to tip the host below the list
    - This brings up a splash page to choose payment method (paypal, venmo, etc)
- Button in top right to log in (This is for the admin/host to manage settings/users/songs/etc)

User Level:
- Ability to signup to sing, see current list of singers, and press buttons to tip host

Admin Level:
- Can add/remove people from the list
- Manually add songs to the MongoDB
- View data on users
    - # times they have signed up
    - Songs they have sang
    - Tip amount?
- Ability to start/stop karaoke sessions
    - Maybe useful to have multiple "sessions" happening at the same time?
    - Kahoot style with session code for configuration
    - Set location of karaoke
